Here a system based on serial propagation of bacteriophage T7 in the presence of a mutagen was used to create the first completely known phylogeny. Restriction-site maps of the terminal lineages were used to infer the evolutionary history of the experimental lines for comparison to the known history and actual ancestors. The five methods used to reconstruct branching pattern all predicted the correct topology but varied in their predictions of branch lengths; one method also predicts ancestral restriction maps and was found to be greater than 98 percent accurate.},

	abstract = {Simulating multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) using probabilistic models of sequence evolution plays an important role in the evaluation of phylogenetic inference tools and is crucial to the development of novel learning-based approaches for phylogenetic reconstruction, for instance, neural networks. These models and the resulting simulated data need to be as realistic as possible to be indicative of the performance of the developed tools on empirical data and to ensure that neural networks trained on simulations perform well on empirical data. Over the years, numerous models of evolution have been published with the goal to represent as faithfully as possible the sequence evolution process and thus simulate empirical-like data. In this study, we simulated DNA and protein MSAs under increasingly complex models of evolution with and without insertion/deletion (indel) events using a state-of-the-art sequence simulator. We assessed their realism by quantifying how accurately supervised learning methods are able to predict whether a given MSA is simulated or empirical.Our results show that we can distinguish between empirical and simulated MSAs with high accuracy using two distinct and independently developed classification approaches across all tested models of sequence evolution. Our findings suggest that the current state-of-the-art models fail to accurately replicate several aspects of empirical MSAs, including site-wise rates as well as amino acid and nucleotide composition.},

Ree and Sanmartín ({\textless}jats:italic{\textgreater}Journal of Biogeography{\textless}/jats:italic{\textgreater}, 45, 741–749, 2018) critiqued the comparison of Dispersal–Extinction–Cladogenesis (DEC) and a modification of it, DEC+J, which adds the process of jump dispersal at speciation. DEC+J provides highly significant improvements in model fit on most (although not all) datasets. They claim that the comparison is statistically invalid for a variety of reasons. I analyse the key claims made by the critique.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}{\textless}/jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:title{\textgreater}Location{\textless}/jats:title{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:p{\textgreater}Simulated data.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}{\textless}/jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:title{\textgreater}Taxon{\textless}/jats:title{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:p{\textgreater}Simulated data.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}{\textless}/jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:title{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/jats:title{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:p{\textgreater}Likelihood calculations are checked by comparison between programs and by-hand calculations, and by summing likelihoods across all possible datasets.

DEC+J fits better on datasets because the DEC model is statistically inadequate in the common situation when most species have geographical ranges of single areas; the DEC model requires long residence times of multi-area ranges, and when these are not observed, a model that does produce such data patterns, such as DEC+J, prevails. More fundamentally, statistical comparison of DEC and DEC+J produces identical log-likelihood differences to statistical comparison of two submodels of ClaSSE where extinction rates are fixed to 0.{\textless}/jats:p{\textgreater}{\textless}/jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:sec{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:title{\textgreater}Main Conclusions{\textless}/jats:title{\textgreater}{\textless}jats:p{\textgreater}DEC fails a basic model adequacy check for understandable reasons, while DEC+J does not.

	abstract = {{\textless}jats:title{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/jats:title{\textgreater} {\textless}jats:p{\textgreater}Computing ancestral ranges via the Dispersion Extinction and Cladogensis (DEC) model of biogeography is characterized by an exponential number of states relative to the number of regions considered. This is because the DEC model requires computing a large matrix exponential, which typically accounts for up to 80\% of overall runtime. Therefore, the kinds of biogeographical analyses that can be conducted under the DEC model are limited by the number of regions under consideration. In this work, we present a completely redesigned efficient version of the popular tool Lagrange which is up to 49 times faster with multithreading enabled, and is also 26 times faster when using only one thread. We call this new version Lagrange-NG (Lagrange-Next Generation). The increased computational efficiency allows Lagrange-NG to analyze datasets with a large number of regions in a reasonable amount of time, up to 12 regions in approximately 18 min. We achieve these speedups using a relatively new method of computing the matrix exponential based on Krylov subspaces. In order to validate the correctness of Lagrange-NG, we also introduce a novel metric on range distributions for trees so that researchers can assess the difference between any two range inferences. Finally, Lagrange-NG exhibits substantially higher adherence to coding quality standards. It improves a respective software quality indicator as implemented in the SoftWipe tool from average (5.5; Lagrange) to high (7.8; Lagrange-NG). Lagrange-NG is freely available under GPL2.
