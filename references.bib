These models and the resulting simulated data need to be as realistic as possible to be indicative of the performance of the developed tools on empirical data and to ensure that neural networks trained on simulations perform well on empirical data. Over the years, numerous models of evolution have been published with the goal to represent as faithfully as possible the sequence evolution process and thus simulate empirical-like data. In this study, we simulated DNA and protein MSAs under increasingly complex models of evolution with and without insertion/deletion (indel) events using a state-of-the-art sequence simulator. We assessed their realism by quantifying how accurately supervised learning methods are able to predict whether a given MSA is simulated or empirical.Our results show that we can distinguish between empirical and simulated MSAs with high accuracy using two distinct and independently developed classification approaches across all tested models of sequence evolution. Our findings suggest that the current state-of-the-art models fail to accurately replicate several aspects of empirical MSAs, including site-wise rates as well as amino acid and nucleotide composition.},

This is because the DEC model requires computing a large matrix exponential, which typically accounts for up to 80\% of overall runtime. Therefore, the kinds of biogeographical analyses that can be conducted under the DEC model are limited by the number of regions under consideration. In this work, we present a completely redesigned efficient version of the popular tool Lagrange which is up to 49 times faster with multithreading enabled, and is also 26 times faster when using only one thread. We call this new version Lagrange-NG (Lagrange-Next Generation). The increased computational efficiency allows Lagrange-NG to analyze datasets with a large number of regions in a reasonable amount of time, up to 12 regions in approximately 18 min. We achieve these speedups using a relatively new method of computing the matrix exponential based on Krylov subspaces. In order to validate the correctness of Lagrange-NG, we also introduce a novel metric on range distributions for trees so that researchers can assess the difference between any two range inferences. Finally, Lagrange-NG exhibits substantially higher adherence to coding quality standards. It improves a respective software quality indicator as implemented in the SoftWipe tool from average (5.5; Lagrange) to high (7.8; Lagrange-NG). Lagrange-NG is freely available under GPL2.

	abstract = {Sloths, like other xenarthrans, are an extremely interesting group of mammals that, after a long history of evolution and diversification in South America, became established on islands in the Caribbean and later reached North America during the Great American Biotic Interchange. In all three regions, they were part of the impressive Pleistocene megafauna. Most taxa became extinct and only two small, distantly related tree-dwelling genera survived. Here, we incorporate several recently described genera of sloths into an assembled morphological data supermatrix and apply Bayesian inference, using phylogenetic and morphological clock methods, to 64 sloth genera. Thus, we investigate the evolution of the group in terms of the timing of divergence of different lineages and their diversity, morphological disparity and biogeographical history. The phylogeny obtained supports the existence of the commonly recognized clades for the group. Our results provide divergence time estimates for the major clades within Folivora that could not be dated with molecular methods. Lineage diversity shows an early increase, reaching a peak in the Early Miocene followed by a major drop at the end of the Santacrucian (Early Miocene). A second peak in the Late Miocene was also followed by a major drop at the end of the Huayquerian (Late Miocene). Both events show differential impact at the family level. After that, a slight Plio-Pleistocene decline was observed before the marked drop with the extinction at the end of the Pleistocene. Phenotypic evolutionary rates were high during the early history of the clade, mainly associated with Mylodontidae, but rapidly decreased to lower values around 25 Ma, whereas Megalonychidae had lower rates at the beginning followed by a steady increase, peaking during the Late Miocene and the Pliocene. Morphological disparity showed a similar trend, with an early increase, followed by a slowly increasing phase through the Late Oligocene and Early Miocene, and ending with another increase beginning at the middle of the Miocene. Biogeographic analysis showed southern South America as the most probable area of origin of the clade and the main region in which the early diversification events took place. Both Megatheriinae and Nothrotheriinae basal nodes were strongly correlated with Andean uplift events, whereas the early history of Mylodontidae is closely associated with southern South America and also shows an early occupation of the northern regions. Within Megalonychidae, our results show Choloepus as a descendant of an island dispersing ancestor and a probable re-ingression to South America by a clade that originated in Central or North America.},

	abstract = {Aim Palms (Arecaceae/Palmae) are a model group for evolutionary studies in the tropics. Family-wide data on taxonomy, phylogenetics and distribution are now available, but a general framework of palm evolution is still lacking. The overall aim of this study, published in two companion papers, is to seek evolutionary explanations for the geographical distribution of palm lineages and species diversity patterns at global and regional levels. In this first paper we undertake a detailed analysis of palm biogeography for all major lineages in a global context, comparing our results to the fossil record, molecular dating studies and previously established biogeographical hypotheses for the family. Location Global. Methods A dated phylogeny of all palm genera and distributional data were used to infer ancestral areas. A global model of area evolution for tropical lineages was formulated and ancestral areas were reconstructed using a maximum likelihood approach under the dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis model. Results The crown node divergence of palms and divergences of all five subfamilies occurred before the end of the Cretaceous within Laurasian regions. Early range expansions into South America took place in the stem lineages of subfamilies Arecoideae and Ceroxyloideae, and into Africa and South America in Cretaceous lineages within subfamily Calamoideae. The largest subfamily Arecoideae underwent its early diversification history in South America and has been an important source of lineages expanding into other regions, notably in the major Indo-Pacific tribe Areceae. In contrast, the history of subfamily Coryphoideae was primarily Laurasian, supporting earlier boreotropical hypotheses for the group. Dispersals across Wallace's Line are prevalent in major groups of Arecoideae, Calamoideae and Coryphoideae, both before and after the Miocene geological evolution of the Malesian Archipelago. Main conclusions We present the first robust biogeographical hypothesis for the evolution of palms in space and time. Although palms show evidence of dispersal limitation, our findings highlight the role of long-distance dispersal events in the establishment of major biogeographical patterns of palm clades. This is consistent with the growing evidence for long-distance dispersal as a major mechanism underpinning the distribution of tropical lineages.},

Here, we tested several alternative hypotheses in Eneopterinae crickets, a diverse subfamily presenting a disjunct worldwide distribution. We inferred a dated phylogeny of Eneopterinae and reconstructed their biogeographical history to unravel the origin of their present-day distribution, focusing on their multiple origins in the Neotropics. Location Worldwide. Methods We sampled 62 eneopterine species representing all extant genera. We inferred their phylogenetic relationships through Bayesian and maximum likelihood approaches based on four mitochondrial and three nuclear gene sequences. Divergence time estimates were inferred using Bayesian relaxed clock approaches and primary fossil calibrations. Biogeographical analyses were conducted with the default dispersal–extinction–cladogenesis (DEC) model and a variant model (DEC+J), which accounts for rare-jump dispersal events. Results Our dating analyses showed that the Eneopterinae is far older than expected and its diversification can be traced back to the Late Cretaceous (c. 76 Ma). In this context, the most supported biogeographical scenario (under DEC+J) suggests that the Neotropics were colonized twice independently: first during the break-up of Gondwana, when Antarctica, Australia and South America started separating (compatible with a vicariance event if relying on the result of the DEC model alone); later through a northern recolonization originating from Southeast Asia, likely related to a Holarctic Boreotropical distribution of an eneopterine lineage during the Eocene. Main conclusions We provided a dated worldwide biogeographical framework for the Eneopterinae crickets. Overall, the subfamily disjunct distribution pattern is better explained by both ancient and recent dispersal events. Whether this could reflect a widespread pattern in insect groups exhibiting a disjunct distribution remains to be investigated by studying other insect lineages. The information gathered here will also help foster new directions for future studies concerning the acoustic innovations of this clade.},

It is well known that fossil pollen and plant macrofossil data provide limited information on distribution and abundance of small or diffuse tree populations. Nevertheless, the estimates of potential migration rates that are currently in use rely on assumptions about how fossil pollen and macrofossils record such populations. To better understand how such assumptions may influence estimates of spread rate, we related modern tree distributions to surface pollen abundance, using assumptions that are routinely applied to paleoecological data. We were unable to reconstruct the modern ranges of two species that are well represented in sediments using pollen and macrofossils from sediment surface samples. The ranges of American beech (Fagus grandifolia) and yellow birch (Betula alleghaniensis) include large areas where these trees are not abundant, and these were impossible to identify using pollen and macrofossil data, respectively. Our analysis supports the view that populations of these and other species existed at low densities over extensive areas in the past, and such areas would not be accurately mapped using fossil data. If so, estimates of past migration rates could be inaccurate.},

Consequently, users of these software packages are simultaneously forced to use a number of programs for a given study, while also lacking the freedom to explore models that have not been implemented by the developers of those programs. We developed a new open-source software package, RevBayes, to address these problems. RevBayes is entirely based on probabilistic graphical models, a powerful generic framework for specifying and analyzing statistical models. Phylogenetic-graphical models can be speciﬁed interactively in RevBayes, piece by piece, using a new succinct and intuitive language called Rev. Rev is similar to the R language and the BUGS model-speciﬁcation language, and should be easy to learn for most users. The strength of RevBayes is the simplicity with which one can design, specify, and implement new and complex models. Fortunately, this tremendous ﬂexibility does not come at the cost of slower computation; as we demonstrate, RevBayes outperforms competing software for several standard analyses. Compared with other programs, RevBayes has fewer black-box elements. Users need to explicitly specify each part of the model and analysis. Although this explicitness may initially be unfamiliar, we are convinced that this transparency will improve understanding of phylogenetic models in our ﬁeld. Moreover, it will motivate the search for improvements to existing methods by brazenly exposing the model choices that we make to critical scrutiny.

As a result, research in the biological sciences is now dependent on computational tools capable of carrying out complex analyses. These tools must be validated before they can be used, but what is understood as validation varies widely among methodological contributions. This may be a consequence of the still embryonic stage of the literature on statistical software validation for computational biology. Our manuscript aims to advance this literature. Here, we describe, illustrate, and introduce new good practices for assessing the correctness of a model implementation with an emphasis on Bayesian methods. We also introduce a suite of functionalities for automating validation protocols. It is our hope that the guidelines presented here help sharpen the focus of discussions on (as well as elevate) expected standards of statistical software for biology.},

	abstract = {With Next Generation Sequencing data being routinely used, evolutionary biology is transforming into a computational science. Thus, researchers have to rely on a growing number of increasingly complex software. All widely used core tools in the field have grown considerably, in terms of the number of features as well as lines of code and consequently, also with respect to software complexity. A topic that has received little attention is the software engineering quality of widely used core analysis tools. Software developers appear to rarely assess the quality of their code, and this can have potential negative consequences for end-users. To this end, we assessed the code quality of 16 highly cited and compute-intensive tools mainly written in C/C++ (e.g., MrBayes, MAFFT, SweepFinder, etc.) and JAVA (BEAST) from the broader area of evolutionary biology that are being routinely used in current data analysis pipelines. Because, the software engineering quality of the tools we analyzed is rather unsatisfying, we provide a list of best practices for improving the quality of existing tools and list techniques that can be deployed for developing reliable, high quality scientific software from scratch. Finally, we also discuss journal as well as science policy and, more importantly, funding issues that need to be addressed for improving software engineering quality as well as ensuring support for developing new and maintaining existing software. Our intention is to raise the awareness of the community regarding software engineering quality issues and to emphasize the substantial lack of funding for scientific software development.},

The description covers the architectureof the redundant computer set, associated redundancy design requirementsa,nd the technique used to detect a failed computer and to identify this failure on-board to the crew. Significant redundancy management requirements consist of imposing a total failure coverage on all flightcritical functions,when more than two redundant computersare operating in flight, and a maximum failure coverage forlimited storage and processing time, when only two are operating. The basic design technique consists of using dedicated redundancy management hardware and softwareto allow each computer to judge the ``health'' of the others by comparing computer outputs and to ``vote'' on the judgments. In formulatingthe design, hardware simplicity, operational flexibility,and minimum computer resource utilization were used as criteria.},

  abstract = {The field of phylogenetics has burgeoned into a great diversity of statistical models, providing researchers with a vast amount of analytical tools for investigating the evolutionary theory. This abundance of theoretical work has the merit that many different aspects of evolution can be investigated using various types of data. However, empiricists may sometimes struggle to find the right model for their needs amid such variety. In particular, some computer programs gather the theory of many different models, published in hundreds of different papers, within the same operational framework. This makes it particularly difficult for users to obtain comprehensive information about the assumptions and structure of various models. Yet, a large part of phylogenetic models are structured in individual modules that can be linked together in the same conceptual framework, akin to some sort of phylogenetic supermodel. In this paper, we propose to browse through the network of phylogenetic models, emphasizing their modular structure, with the purpose to outline the commonalities and differences of individual models. Focusing on probabilistic models, we describe how to go from the model assumptions to the corresponding probability distributions as pedagogically as possible. To achieve this task, we resort heavily on graph theory to represent the probabilistic relationships among parameters and data, and present the models in their most elementary form (i.e. including parameters that are generally marginalized out), which simplifies the mathematics considerably. We concentrate on models designed for species trees, but evoke the link with other types of trees (e.g. gene trees).},

Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions.

	abstract = {User-input validators play an essential role in guarding a web application against application-level attacks. Hence, the security of the web application can be compromised by defective validators. To detect defects in validators, testing is one of the most commonly used methodologies. Testing can be performed by manually writing test inputs and oracles, but this manual process is often laborintensive and ineffective. On the other hand, automated test generators cannot generate test oracles in the absence of speciﬁcations, which are often not available in practice. To address this issue in testing validators, we propose a novel approach, called MiTV, that applies Multiple-implementation Testing for Validators, i.e., comparing the behavior of a validator under test with other validators of the same type. These other validators of the same type can be collected from either open or proprietary source code repositories. To show the effectiveness of MiTV, we applied MiTV on 53 different validators (of 6 common types) for web applications. Our results show that MiTV detected real defects in 70\% of the validators.},

	abstract = {Regional features of geography, such as size or distance, are expected to shape how lineages disperse, go extinct, and speciate. Yet this fundamental link between geographical context and evolutionary consequence has not been fully incorporated into phylogenetic models of biogeography. We designed a model that allows variation in regional features (size, distance, insularity, and oceanic separation) to inform rates of biogeographic change. Our approach uses a Bayesian hierarchical modeling framework to transform regional values of quantitative and categorical features into evolutionary rates. We also make use of a parametric range split score to quantify range cohesion for widespread species, thereby allowing geographical barriers to initiate “range-splitting” speciation events. Applying our approach to Anolis lizards, a species-rich neotropical radiation, we found that distance between regions, especially over water, decreases dispersal rates and increases between-region speciation rates. For distances less than ∼470 km over land, anoles tended to disperse faster than they speciate between regions. Over oceans, the equivalent maximum range cohesion distance fell to ∼160 km. Our results suggest that the historical biogeography of founder event speciation may be productively studied when the same barriers that inhibit dispersal also promote speciation between regions.},

This is potentially confounding to comparative analyses of species distributions because current models do not allow reciprocal interactions between the evolution of ranges and the growth of phylogenetic trees. Here, we introduce a likelihood-based approach to estimating region-dependent rates of speciation, extinction, and range evolution from a phylogeny, using a new model in which these processes are interdependent. We demonstrate the method with simulation tests that accurately recover parameters relating to the mode of speciation and source--sink dynamics. We then apply it to the evolution of habitat occupancy in Californian plant communities, where we find higher rates of speciation in chaparral than in forests and evidence for expanding habitat tolerances.},
